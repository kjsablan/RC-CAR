# RC CAR
 PCB Design for an RC CAR (Senior Project)
This is a senior design project this is currently in development and will be complete by May 2023.
The Purpose is to design a Printed Circuit Board using the Eagle software to create a circuit schematic, convert it to a board layout, generate the gerber files, and send the files out to a company to print the board. 
Then Using a microcontroller (ATMega 328P) develop firmware and create a product (RC Car)
My group has completed creating the board and now are building the RC Car.
All files (Project Report/Journal article) are still not completed and will be complete at the end of this semester (May 2023)
